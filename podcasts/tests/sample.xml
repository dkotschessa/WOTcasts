   <media:description>Wheel of Time Season 2 is only a few short weeks away, we had our trailer drop not too long ago and I did do a trailer breakdown video for it (over an hour long!!) but that doesn't mean that ever piece of Wheel of Time news I included and every theory was right, I got a few things wrong and I missed a few things as well! So join me as I dive back into the trailer and coprrect some of my mistakes and add some new things I missed!!

   <media:description>The Wheel of Time released a new scene at the end of Episode 8! We now have a sneak peek at Season 2 of The Wheel of Time in a new clip that depicts the Darkfriend Social! There is a ton to unpack from this scene, from where the Darkfriend Social takes place (not where you think!) to who attends and how they are making the Antagonists of the show a little more relatable than in the books! Either way I'm really excited to break down this new Season 2 sneak peek of The Wheel of Time!!!

   <media:description>More Wheel of Time Casting! One of them is for both Season 2 and 3 and is an actress already known to the fandom, Nyokabi Gethaiga. WotSeries.com has uncovered her role in the show and I discuss how she may fit into both seasons. The second casting is Callum Kerr, a self proclaimed country music star as Galad Trakand, no that is not a typo his CV lists him as a Trakand and there are a few theories as to why this is. I put at least one of them to rest in this video so make sure you join in!

   <media:description>The Wheel of Time Season 2 Trailer has dropped!! Of course I had to do a HUGE Wheel of Time breakdown!! Join me as I break down all of the easter eggs and notable moments from the Trailer. Yes this is a LONG Wheel of Time video, but there is just so much to unpack! We see our first glimpse of Lanfear, the Seanchan in all of their terrible glory, Rand channeling, the accepted test. There is just too much Wheel of Time goodness to go around!!!! Season 2 is just a few short weeks away!!!!


There is a pinned comment that has all of the corrections as we get new information! reply to that for any mistake I make! (or just add it below )

   <media:description>Wheel of Time Season 2 Trailer is THIS WEEK! We now have a date and a time for the trailer! We also have some promotional images released when they announced this, two that we have seen similar ones to before and one brand new one featuring Madelyn Madden and Ceara Coveney! Also The Wheel of Time Twitter account did a thing! We had sort of a fan centric marketing campaign this evening with some pictures of the horn of Valere coming out of a box opened by High Lord Turak! We chat about that, then we discuss is The Wheel of Time still on set? Are they filming even though SAG and WGA are on strike? I have those answers for you today!

   <media:description>SAG and the WGA are both on Strike, and we get a new 3 second clip of The Wheel of Time! I break down the clip frame by frame and discuss some of the new stuff we saw in there as well as give my thoughts on where it fits into the Wheel of TimeSeason 2, and then I talk just a bit about the strikes. How will they effect The Wheel of Time, marketing, cast appearances? Filming? I speculate on what the next few days, weeks or months may look like.

   <media:description>The Wheel of Time has revealed its Season 2 poster! It does not disappoint (unlike the ... interesting ... one we got for Season 1!) It has a ton of little Easter Eggs in it and I try my best to cover them all from Perrins Hammer, to the absolute gorgeous weaves around some of the characters, Rands shaved head and Rosamund Pike wielding a knife like  she means to use it on any Shadowspawn nearby! I also give a little update on my hopes for SDCC and what we may get in light of the possible SAG strike that may become official in a few hours. Join me for some Wheel of Time Easter Egg hunting fun!

   <media:description>Is Wheel of Time attending the San Diego Comic Con? Maybe? We don't have official confirmation just yet but we have some speculation that we may see our favorite fantasy series show up there in a panel. However, recently Variety is reporting a ton of big companies are pulling out of SDCC over the Writers strike, and I have a little info from one of my sources as well about what is possible for Amazon and The Wheel of Time. There is still hope! Also thank you for 2.5 million views! Both myself and Mat Hatch from The Dusty Wheel have hit that milestone around the same time so we are celebrating together this Wednesday on The Dusty Wheel!
