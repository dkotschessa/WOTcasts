We started with the Wheel of Time novels but we ran out of them, so now we read all sorts of books.\n\nWe recap the events of the story as we go, so you don't have to read along unless you want to.\n\nThese books are pretty great already, but what we add is a lot of jokes of varying hilarity, and a little insight. We have a great time recording these and we hope you'll have a great time listening.
